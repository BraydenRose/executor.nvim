This plugin makes it easy to run commands in the background and know if they
succeeded or fail.

A typical workflow looks like:

1. `:ExecutorRun`: runs your given task. If it's the first time you've run it,
you will be prompted for a command. After that, it will remember and re-use
your command (See `:ExecutorSetCommand` if you'd like to change it).

2. The task will run in the background. You will get a small notification when
the task has finished, and it will tell you if it was a success or not. This
is based on the exit code of the command you ran.

3. You can use `:ExecutorShowDetail` to reveal the detail window showing the
task output. By default this will open in a floating window, but it can be
configured to use a split too.

4. `:ExecutorHideDetail` will hide the detail window. By default it will open in a floating
window, but it can be configured to use a split too. See *configuration*
below.

5. `:ExecutorToggleDetail` will hide the detail view if it is visible,
otherwise it will show it.

Install executor.nvim using your preferred plugin manager. This plugin also
depends on https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim, so ensure that is
installed too.

Once installed, initialise the plugin with:

  require('executor').setup({})

================================================================================
                                                               *configuration*

`setup` takes a Lua table with the following options. The options provided are
the default options.

  require('executor').setup({
    -- View details of the task run in a split, rather than a popup window.
    -- Set this to `false` to use a popup.
    use_split = true,

    -- Configure the split. These are ignored if you are using a popup.
    split = {
      -- One of "top", "right", "bottom" or "left"
      position = "right",
      -- The number of columns to take up. This sets the split to 1/4 of the
      -- space. If you're using the split at the top or bottom, you could also
      -- use `vim.o.lines` to set this relative to the height of the window.
      size = math.floor(vim.o.columns * 1/4)
    },

    -- Configure the popup. These are ignored if you are using a split.
    popup = {
      -- Sets the width of the popup to 3/5ths of the screen's width.
      width = math.floor(vim.o.columns * 3/5),
      -- Sets the height to almost full height, allowing for some padding.
      height = vim.o.lines - 20,
    }
  })

================================================================================
                                                                    *commands*

No keys are bound by default; it is left up to you to bind your preferred keys
to each option.

Available commands:

* `ExecutorRun`: run the stored command. Will prompt for the command if it
* does not exist. Use `<Esc>` or `q` in the initial text prompt to cancel.
* `ExecutorSetCommand`: change the command that runs when `ExecutorRun` is
* invoked. You can use `<Esc>` or `q` in normal mode to cancel this command.
* `ExecutorShowDetail`: reveal the details window for the last execution run.
* `ExecutorHideDetail`: hide the details window for the last execution run.
* `ExecutorToggleDetail`: toggle the visibility of the details window.
